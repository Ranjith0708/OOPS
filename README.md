# OOPS

This repository is for practising Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in Java.

## Basics of OOP in Java

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of objects, which can contain data and code to manipulate that data. Java is a widely used OOP language. The four main principles of OOP are:

1. **Encapsulation**: Bundling data (fields) and methods that operate on the data into a single unit called a class. It helps in hiding the internal details of objects.
2. **Inheritance**: Mechanism by which one class can inherit the properties and methods of another class, promoting code reuse.
3. **Polymorphism**: Ability of an object to take many forms. It allows methods to perform different tasks based on the object that is invoking them.
4. **Abstraction**: Hiding complex implementation details and showing only the necessary features of an object.

This repo contains Java code examples and exercises to help you understand and practice these OOP concepts.
